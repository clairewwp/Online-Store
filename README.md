This project aims to develop a web application as an e-commerce store. The application includes 4 dynamic pages with the use of SQLite.

### Web Application Features:
* Landing Page: Allows users to search, filter for products, and add them to the shopping basket.
* Item Detail Page: Provides customers with additional item details.
* Shopping Basket: Displays information about the added products and allows viewing and removing items.
* Checkout Page: Used for entering user details to finalize the order.

### Building Web Applications with Flask:
This web application was built using Flask and leverages the following technologies:
* HTML & Bootstrap CSS for the frontend design.
* SQLAlchemy for interacting with the SQLite database.
* Flask Templates for rendering dynamic web pages.
* WTForms for handling form validation and data submission.
